### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elizabeth Medina,

I bake cakes and cookies as well as decorate them to your liking. I've dedicated myself to custom designs for 6 years, so if shown a design that isn't mine, I can use it as inspiration to suit your needs. I have such a passion for all pastries so I'm currently studying to become a pastry chef. I'm fluent in both english and spanish, so whatever baking needs you have, I'm the one for you!
